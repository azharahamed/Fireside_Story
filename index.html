  <title>Fireside Story</title>

<body>
  <p>It was a dark and stormy night. The power had gone out in Azhar's house, his SEED Program project was due at midnight and his battery was on low.</p>
  <P>Azhar called Richard, his classmate, to loan his laptop to him in his time of need. On his way from his car to Azhar's front door, Richard fell, smashing his laptop into pieces.
    Both Azhar and Richard failed the course and had to work at McDonald's.  </P>
